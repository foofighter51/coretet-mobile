## In Progress
- [ ] Fix missing band creation/joining functionality - 80% complete
  - Current state: Buttons exist but don't implement actual workflows
  - Next steps: Connect to Supabase band operations

## Blocked Items
- None currently blocked

## New Discoveries
### Tasks Added
- [ ] Implement band creation workflow - Priority: HIGH
- [ ] Implement band joining workflow - Priority: HIGH
- [ ] Connect MainDashboard to real data sources - Priority: MEDIUM
- [ ] Add loading states for async operations - Priority: MEDIUM

### Issues Found
- üêõ Band action buttons non-functional - Severity: HIGH

  - AI-REVIEW pending: 0

## Tomorrow's Recommended Priorities
1. Implement band creation/joining workflows - Est: 2-3 hours
2. Connect MainDashboard to real Supabase data - Est: 1-2 hours
3. Add loading states and error handling for async operations - Est: 1 hour

## Notes for Next Session
- Refactoring successfully completed - app functional with modular architecture
- Rate limiting implementation complete with full documentation
- Authentication context working perfectly with all screens
- Need to complete band management functionality for full user experience

## AI Tool Performance
