# CoreTet Development Status - October 9, 2025 (Midday)

## Session Summary
Implemented collaborative ratings system with aggregated rating display and comprehensive UI/UX improvements including design token expansion and layout fixes.

## Completed Features

### Collaborative Ratings System
- **Aggregated Ratings Display**: Shows all collaborator ratings for each track in playlist view
  - Gray icons with light background for collaborator ratings
  - Colored icons with colored background when current user has that rating
  - Displays 1-3 rating badges (listened/liked/loved) based on who rated
  - Layout accommodates up to 3 badges side-by-side before duration
- **Rating Removal**: Users can now remove their rating by tapping the same rating button again
- **Database Integration**:
  - Created `fetchAggregatedRatings()` function to get all ratings per track
  - Updated `handleRate()` to support deletion via `db.ratings.delete()`
  - Automatic refresh of aggregated ratings after any rating change

### UI/UX Improvements

#### Track Title Overflow Fix
- Fixed long track titles pushing rows past screen edge
- Implemented text truncation with 180px max-width and ellipsis
- Full titles viewable in Track Detail Modal (long-press)
- Removed `flex: 1` from inner container, added `maxWidth: '100%'` constraint

#### Design Token System Expansion
- Added semantic color categories:
  - **Surface colors**: primary, secondary, hover, active, disabled
  - **Border colors**: default, light, focus
  - **Text colors**: primary, secondary, muted, disabled, inverse
  - **Rating colors**: listened/liked/loved with bg/bgLight/bgUltraLight variants
  - **Feedback colors**: error, success, warning with bg/border/text
- Added dimensions: `touchTarget.minimum: '44px'`
- Replaced 100+ hardcoded colors across codebase
- Replaced 64+ hardcoded font sizes
- Replaced 50+ hardcoded spacing values

#### Swipe Functionality
- Increased `maxSwipe` from 150px to 180px (3 × 60px buttons)
- Now fully reveals all three rating buttons (listened/liked/loved)
- Rating button width: 60px each for better touch targets

#### Layout & Spacing Fixes
- **PlaybackBar positioning**:
  - Bottom position: 68px (TabBar 60px + 8px gap)
  - Adds visual breathing room between PlaybackBar and TabBar
- **Content padding**:
  - With track playing: `paddingBottom: 164px` (TabBar 60px + PlaybackBar 84px + gap 8px + margin 12px)
  - No track playing: `paddingBottom: 84px` (TabBar 60px + margin 24px)
- **Track list spacers**: Added 16px spacer divs at end of both Tracks and Playlist track lists
- **Result**: Last track no longer hidden behind TabBar or PlaybackBar

### Playlist Management
- **Share Playlist in Menu**: Added "Share Playlist" as first option in three-dot menu
  - Previously only accessible from playlist list view
  - Uses native share sheet on iOS/Android
  - Copies to clipboard on web
  - Menu order: Share → Edit Title → Edit Tracks → Delete

### Bug Fixes
- **Playlist Track Addition**: Fixed duplicate position constraint error
  - Changed from `items.length + 1` to `Math.max(...items.map(item => item.position)) + 1`
  - Prevents conflicts when tracks are removed leaving gaps in position sequence
  - Applied to both "Add from Library" and "Upload to Playlist" flows

## Technical Implementation

### Key Files Modified
- `src/components/molecules/SwipeableTrackRow.tsx` (142 lines changed)
  - Added `aggregatedRatings` prop interface
  - Display logic for 1-3 rating badges with proper coloring
  - Updated `maxSwipe` to 180px
  - Title truncation with `maxWidth: '180px'`

- `src/components/screens/MainDashboard.tsx` (913 lines changed)
  - Added `aggregatedRatings` state and `fetchAggregatedRatings()` function
  - Updated `handleRate()` to support rating removal
  - Updated `loadPlaylistTracks()` to fetch aggregated ratings
  - Fixed `handleAddExistingTracks()` position calculation
  - Added share option to playlist menu dropdown
  - Added 16px spacers after track lists
  - Adjusted PlaybackBar positioning and content padding

- `src/design/designTokens.ts` (101 lines changed)
  - Expanded semantic token structure
  - Added surface, border, text, rating, and feedback color categories
  - Added touch target dimension tokens

### Database Operations
- `db.ratings.getByTrack(trackId)` - Fetch all ratings for a track
- `db.ratings.delete(trackId, userId)` - Remove user's rating
- Position calculation using `Math.max()` to find highest position value

## Current Architecture

### Aggregated Ratings Flow
1. `fetchAggregatedRatings(trackIds)` - Parallel fetch for all tracks using `Promise.all`
2. Count ratings by type (listened/liked/loved) per track
3. Store in `aggregatedRatings` state: `Record<string, { listened: number; liked: number; loved: number }>`
4. Pass to `SwipeableTrackRow` via props
5. Display badges: gray for others, colored when current user matches rating type

### Rating Removal Flow
1. User taps current rating button
2. `handleRate()` detects `currentUserRating === rating`
3. Calls `db.ratings.delete(trackId, userId)`
4. Removes from `trackRatings` state
5. Refreshes `aggregatedRatings` for that track

## Testing Status
- ✅ Track title truncation working correctly
- ✅ Swipe reveals all three rating buttons
- ✅ Aggregated ratings display with proper colors
- ✅ Rating removal functionality working
- ✅ Playlist track addition fixed (no more duplicate position errors)
- ✅ Last track no longer hidden behind TabBar/PlaybackBar
- ✅ Share playlist from detail view menu working
- ✅ Build successful with no errors

## Known Issues
None identified

## Next Steps
- Implement timestamped commenting system
  - Comment creation with optional timestamp
  - Display comments in Track Detail Modal
  - Comment threading (future enhancement)

## Commit Information
- **Commit**: `53f43a41` - Add collaborative ratings system and UI/UX improvements
- **Branch**: master
- **Pushed to**: origin/master
- **Files changed**: 3 files, 734 insertions, 422 deletions

## Session Notes
- Systematic approach to design token replacement improved consistency
- Max position calculation more robust than simple count-based approach
- Spacer divs combined with paddingBottom effectively prevent content hiding
- Aggregated ratings provide good collaborative feedback without cluttering UI
- Rating removal improves UX by allowing users to correct mistakes
