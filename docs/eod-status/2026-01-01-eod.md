## Session Summary
- **Date Generated**: 2026-01-01 (created retrospectively on 2026-01-02 16:47:22 PST)
- **Duration**: Full day session (continued from previous day's work)
- **Primary Focus**: Demo account creation, UI spacing optimization, dark mode implementation
- **Branch**: master

## Completed Tasks
- [x] **Demo Account SQL Script** - Created comprehensive SQL script for Supabase
  - Fixed SQL syntax errors (removed dangling RETURNING clauses)
  - Generated 4 set lists with 14 tracks total
  - Added realistic metadata: ratings, comments, keywords
  - Resolved missing band_members relationship issue

- [x] **UI Spacing Optimization** - Compressed set list card layout
  - Reduced vertical padding from `lg` (16px) to `sm` (8px)
  - Adjusted internal spacing (title: 2px margin, description: 6px margin-top)
  - Built and synced to iOS successfully
  - Total space savings: ~12-14px per card

- [x] **Dark Mode Implementation** - Complete theme system
  - Created ThemeContext with localStorage persistence
  - Implemented darkTheme.ts based on logo colors:
    - Background: #26313e
    - Accent: #e9a63c (amber)
    - Text: #ffffff
  - Added useDesignTokens hook for theme-aware tokens
  - Integrated toggle in Settings modal with Moon/Sun icons
  - Updated MainDashboard to use themed tokens
  - Wrapped app in ThemeProvider

## In Progress
- [ ] **Dark Mode Testing** - 80% complete
  - Current state: Built and synced to iOS, ready for device testing
  - Next steps: Test dark mode toggle, verify all screens update correctly

## Blocked Items
- None currently

## New Discoveries
### Tasks Added
- [ ] **Update other components for dark mode** - Priority: MED
  - Settings modal, modals, auth screens need theme awareness
  - Estimate: 1-2 hours

### Issues Found
- 🐛 **Missing `xxs` spacing token** - Severity: LOW
  - Location: src/tokens.json
  - Workaround: Used hardcoded pixel values (2px, 6px)
  - Should add `xxs: 2px` to design system

## Code Health Metrics
- **Files Modified**: 16
- **Lines Added/Removed**: +627 -374
- **New Files Created**:
  - `src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`
  - `src/design/darkTheme.ts`
  - `src/design/useDesignTokens.ts`
  - `scripts/create-demo-account.sql`
  - `scripts/seed-demo-account.ts`
  - `scripts/check-demo-data.ts`
  - Multiple documentation files (LANDING_PAGE_GUIDE, LOGO_AND_BRANDING_GUIDE, etc.)

## Tomorrow's Recommended Priorities
1. **Test Dark Mode on Device** - Est: 30 min
   - Verify toggle works
   - Check all screens render correctly
   - Test theme persistence

2. **Extend Dark Mode to All Components** - Est: 2 hours
   - Update auth screens, modals, empty states
   - Add theme support to remaining components

3. **Screenshot Capture** - Est: 1 hour
   - Take demo account screenshots in both light/dark mode
   - Update landing page with real screenshots

## Notes for Next Session
- Demo account credentials: demo@coretet.app / demo123456
- SQL script location: `scripts/create-demo-account.sql`
- Dark mode colors match logo: #26313e background, #e9a63c accent
- Build command: `npm run build && npx cap sync ios`
- Theme persists via localStorage key 'theme'

## Key Accomplishments
### Demo Account System
- Created robust SQL script that handles existing data gracefully
- Generates realistic band/set list/track structure
- Includes 29 keywords with colors, 14 tracks across 4 set lists
- Sample comments and ratings for authentic look

### UI Polish
- Improved space efficiency in set list view
- Cards now show more content without scrolling
- Maintained readability with careful spacing tweaks

### Theme Architecture
- Clean separation: ThemeContext → useDesignTokens hook → components
- Type-safe theme switching
- No hardcoded colors in MainDashboard
- Easy to extend to other components

## AI Tool Performance
- **Claude Code Effectiveness**: 5/5 - Successfully debugged SQL errors, implemented complete theme system
- **Workflow**: Iterative approach worked well (create → test → fix → rebuild)
- **Challenges**: Initial confusion about Capacitor build process, resolved by understanding build → sync workflow
