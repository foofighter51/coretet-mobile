- **Primary Focus**: iOS 18.6 Simulator Debugging, Phase 1 RLS Deployment & Monitoring Setup
- **Branch**: master

## Completed Tasks

## In Progress
- [ ] Phase 1 RLS Monitoring (7-day period: Oct 17-24, 2025) - 0% complete
  - Current state: Just deployed, no feedback yet
  - Next steps: Monitor tester reports for data access issues

## Blocked Items
None

## New Discoveries

### Issues Found
- üêõ iOS 18.6 Simulator WKWebView keyboard bug - Severity: HIGH (testing-only)
  - Location: iOS 18.6 Simulator runtime (Apple system bug)
  - Error: `-[RTIInputSystemClient remoteTextInputSessionWithID:textSuggestionsChanged:] Can only set suggestions for an active session`
  - Workaround: Use iOS 17 simulator or physical device for testing
  - Impact: Simulator testing workflow only, production unaffected

- üêõ User was bypassing login screen due to cached auth - Severity: LOW
  - Made it harder to detect when login fields stopped working
  - Resolved by testing on fresh simulator/device

### Tasks Added
- [ ] Monitor Phase 1 RLS for 7 days (Oct 17-24) - Priority: CRITICAL
- [ ] Collect and analyze tester feedback on new features - Priority: HIGH
- [ ] Watch for Apple iOS 18.x updates that may fix WKWebView bug - Priority: LOW

## Code Health Metrics
- **Files Modified**: 17 files (today's session + Phase 1 RLS from yesterday)

- [docs/TESTING_CHECKLIST.md](docs/TESTING_CHECKLIST.md) - NEW: Comprehensive Phase 1 testing guide
- docs/screenshots/ - NEW: Simulator error screenshots and tester examples

## Key Files from Phase 1 RLS (pushed today)
- [supabase/migrations/20251017_enable_tracks_rls_phase1.sql](supabase/migrations/20251017_enable_tracks_rls_phase1.sql) - Phase 1 RLS policies
- [lib/supabase.ts](lib/supabase.ts) - JWT claim injection for RLS
- [src/components/molecules/PlaybackBar.tsx](src/components/molecules/PlaybackBar.tsx) - Draggable scrubber
- [src/components/molecules/SwipeableTrackRow.tsx](src/components/molecules/SwipeableTrackRow.tsx) - Unread comments indicator
- [docs/security/2025-10-16-security-audit.md](docs/security/2025-10-16-security-audit.md) - Comprehensive security review

## Tomorrow's Recommended Priorities
1. **Monitor Phase 1 RLS** - Daily check for tester reports - Est: 15min/day
2. **Wait for tester feedback** - Passive monitoring - Est: N/A
3. **Review any iOS 18.x updates** - Check Apple release notes - Est: 5min

## Notes for Next Session
- iOS 17 simulator downloaded and ready for testing
- All commits pushed to origin/master (verified clean)
- Phase 1 RLS baseline: 235 total tracks (223 band, 12 personal)
- Monitoring period: Oct 17-24, 2025 (7 days)
- Success criteria defined in [docs/TESTING_CHECKLIST.md](docs/TESTING_CHECKLIST.md)
- No immediate development work planned; waiting state

## Problem-Solving Summary
**Problem**: Unable to type in username/password fields in iOS 18.6 simulator

**Investigation Process**:
1. Initially suspected PlaybackBar NaN errors ‚Üí Added guards ‚Üí No effect
2. Suspected CSS interference ‚Üí Stripped to minimal ‚Üí Caused white screen
3. Suspected touch event handlers ‚Üí Removed all ‚Üí No effect
4. Rolled back to Oct 14 commit ‚Üí Still broken (critical finding)
5. Tested localhost:3000 ‚Üí Works perfectly
6. Tested physical iPhone device ‚Üí Works perfectly
7. Conclusion: iOS 18.6 WKWebView system bug, not our code

**Resolution**:
- Documented issue in [docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md](docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md)
- Established testing workflow: localhost ‚Üí iOS 17 simulator ‚Üí physical device
- No code changes needed (issue is external to our app)

## AI Tool Performance
- **Copilot Effectiveness**: N/A - Not used this session
- **Claude Code Effectiveness**: 3/5 - Spent significant time investigating code issues that turned out to be iOS system bug; however, systematic testing approach ultimately identified root cause correctly
- **Coordination Issues**: Multiple false starts due to assuming code was at fault; eventually discovered external cause through process of elimination
