## Files Changed Today

### New Files Created
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/components/layouts/DesktopSidebarWithTree.tsx` | Sidebar with collapsible set list tree navigation |
| `src/components/layouts/DesktopThreeColumnLayout.tsx` | 3-column layout wrapper component |
| `src/components/organisms/TrackDetailPanel.tsx` | Right panel showing track details, playback, ratings |

### Modified Files
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `MainDashboard.tsx` | Integrated 3-column layout, detail panel state, filter logic |
| `DesktopTrackRow.tsx` | Always-visible rating buttons, fixed dropdown positioning |
| `FilterButton.tsx` | Simplified filter options (liked/loved by me/multiple) |
| `PlaybackBar.tsx` | Added onTrackTitleClick handler |
| `AdaptiveLayout.tsx` | Minor layout adjustments |
| `designTokens.ts` | Added layout dimensions for 3-column |

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Equal Column Widths**: Track list and detail panel both use `calc((100vw - 240px) / 2)` for 50/50 split
2. **Fixed Positioning for Detail Panel**: Using `position: fixed` allows proper layering without overflow issues
3. **Simplified Rating Filter**: Removed "listened" and separate scope toggle in favor of explicit options
4. **AudioRef Passthrough**: Detail panel receives audioRef conditionally (only when displaying currently playing track)

## Tomorrow's Recommended Priorities
1. Commit today's desktop UI changes
2. Add waveform visualization placeholder implementation
3. Implement comments section in detail panel
4. Test responsive behavior at various breakpoints

## Notes for Next Session
- All changes are uncommitted - review and commit before continuing
- Dev server running at http://localhost:3000/
- 3-column layout is functional but needs polish
- Filter dropdown now stays open correctly after simplification

## AI Tool Performance
- **Claude Code Effectiveness**: 5/5 - Excellent for complex multi-file refactoring
- **Coordination Issues**: None
