# EOD Status - 2026-02-05

## Session Summary
- **Date Generated**: 2026-02-05 13:21:19 PST
- **Primary Focus**: Mobile Navigation Parity (Phase 1)
- **Branch**: master

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Mobile Navigation Parity
- [x] Updated `TabId` type to include `'library' | 'works' | 'playlists' | 'shared' | 'more'` - `src/types/index.ts`
- [x] Updated TabBar with 4 tabs (Library, Works, Set Lists, More) - `src/components/molecules/TabBar.tsx`
- [x] Created MobileMoreSheet component with secondary navigation - `src/components/molecules/MobileMoreSheet.tsx`
- [x] Wired up new tabs in MainDashboard - `src/components/screens/MainDashboard.tsx`
  - Added `showMobileMoreSheet` state
  - Updated `handleTabChange` to handle Library tab (shows all tracks)
  - TabBar reflects active Library state when showing all tracks
  - MobileMoreSheet rendered with handlers for: Shared, Settings, Recycle Bin, Sign Out

### Previous Session (context restored)
- [x] Works sharing migration fix (`gen_random_uuid()` instead of `gen_random_bytes()`) - `f4e95d81`
- [x] Library sidebar access on desktop
- [x] Set Lists header with sort options
- [x] Comment filter/sort functionality

## In Progress
- [ ] Phase 2: Mobile Works Experience - Not started
  - WorkDetailView mobile adaptations (full-screen modal mode)
  - Mobile-friendly header with back/share buttons

## Code Changes (This Session)

### Modified Files
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/types/index.ts` | Added 'library' and 'more' to TabId |
| `src/components/molecules/TabBar.tsx` | 4 tabs + onMorePress prop |
| `src/components/screens/MainDashboard.tsx` | MobileMoreSheet integration, tab handling |

### New Files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/components/molecules/MobileMoreSheet.tsx` | Bottom sheet for secondary navigation |

## Uncommitted Changes
```
M  src/components/molecules/TabBar.tsx
M  src/components/screens/MainDashboard.tsx
M  src/types/index.ts
?? src/components/molecules/MobileMoreSheet.tsx
```

## Code Health
- **Build Status**: ✅ Successful (`npm run build` passed)
- **Type Safety**: ✅ No TypeScript errors
- **New Files**: 1 (MobileMoreSheet.tsx)
- **Test Coverage**: Not run this session

## Tomorrow's Recommended Priorities

### Continue Mobile UX Enhancement (Plan Phase 2-4)
1. **Phase 2: Mobile Works Experience** - Priority: HIGH
   - WorkDetailView mobile full-screen mode
   - Mobile-friendly header with back/share buttons
   - Test Works list → detail flow on mobile

2. **Phase 3: Mobile Library Experience** - Priority: MEDIUM
   - TrackActionSheet for long-press actions
   - WorkSelectorSheet / PlaylistSelectorSheet

3. **Phase 4: Touch Gesture Enhancements** - Priority: LOW
   - SwipeableWorkCard component
   - Enhanced swipe actions

### Quick Wins
- Commit current changes to preserve progress
- Verify mobile navigation in browser dev tools (< 768px viewport)

## Notes for Next Session

### Current State
- Mobile TabBar now shows: `[Library] [Works] [Set Lists] [More]`
- "More" tab opens bottom sheet with: Shared, Settings, Recycle Bin, Sign Out
- Library tab uses existing "All Tracks" infrastructure
- Works tab connects to existing Works list/detail views

### Verification Steps
1. Open app on mobile (or narrow browser < 768px)
2. See 4 tabs: Library, Works, Set Lists, More
3. Tap Library → see all tracks
4. Tap Works → see Works list
5. Tap More → bottom sheet with Shared, Settings, Profile

### Plan File Location
`/Users/exleymini/.claude/plans/concurrent-rolling-glade.md` contains the full 4-phase mobile enhancement plan.

## AI Tool Performance
- **Claude Code Effectiveness**: 5/5 - Seamless context restoration, efficient implementation
- **Coordination Issues**: None
