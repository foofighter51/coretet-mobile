## New Discoveries
### Tasks Added
- [ ] Test build on physical device - Priority: HIGH

### Issues Found
- 🐛 Event listener state capture - Severity: HIGH (FIXED)
  - Location: src/components/screens/MainDashboard.tsx:audio event listeners
  - Root cause: Event listeners capture variable values at creation time
  - Fix: Created currentTrackRef to preserve current track for event listeners
- 🐛 White screen when playing shared playlist tracks - Severity: HIGH (FIXED)
  - Location: src/components/molecules/PlaybackBar.tsx
  - Root cause: Component didn't handle null track prop
  - Fix: Added safety check `if (!track) return null;`
- 🐛 Deep link navigation loop - Severity: HIGH (FIXED)
  - Location: src/App.tsx:DeepLinkHandler
  - Root cause: getLaunchUrl() called on every mount

## Key Technical Changes
### iOS Keyboard Viewport Fix (1af602d9)
- **Problem**: Keyboard opening created black space, viewport didn't reset when keyboard closed, TabBar disappeared
- **Solution**:
  - Removed `viewport-fit=cover` from index.html (caused viewport shifting)
  - Changed TabBar to `position: fixed` to ensure visibility
  - Removed `position: fixed` from body CSS (caused viewport shift)
  - Used `100vh` instead of `100%` for proper height calculation
  - Added `paddingBottom` to content area for fixed TabBar spacing
- **Trade-off**: Black bars at status bar and home indicator areas
- **Benefits**: No keyboard viewport issues, stable TabBar, functional text input

### Playlist Sharing Deep Links (3d8f99cd)
- Changed share URLs from `https://` to `coretet://` custom scheme (app-only links)
- Fixed navigation loop with `hasProcessedLaunchUrl` useRef flag
- Added extensive logging for debugging deep link navigation
- Fixed PlaybackBar visibility in PublicPlaylistView (20px bottom padding)
- Added error handling for unauthenticated users viewing shared playlists

### Playlist Organization (3d8f99cd)
- **UI**: Filter toggle with "My Playlists" and "Following" buttons
- **Data**: Separated `createdPlaylists` and `followedPlaylists` in PlaylistContext
- **UX**: Custom empty states for each filter type
- **Permissions**: Disabled add/remove/rename controls for followed playlists
  - Users retain view, play, sort, and filter capabilities
  - Ownership check: `isPlaylistOwner = createdPlaylists.some(p => p.id === currentPlaylist.id)`

### Auto-Play Next Track (3d8f99cd)
- **Feature**: Automatically plays next track when current track ends
- **Implementation**:
  - Created `playNextTrack()` function that finds next track in list
  - Added 'ended' event listener to audio element
  - Works in both Tracks tab and Playlist detail view
- **Critical Fix**: Used `currentTrackRef` to preserve track value for event listeners
  - Event listeners capture variable values at creation time
  - Without ref, `currentTrack` was always `undefined` in the callback
  - Updated ref whenever track changes: `currentTrackRef.current = targetTrack`

### PlaybackBar & TabBar Positioning (3d8f99cd)
- Changed PlaybackBar to `position: fixed` with `bottom: 80px` (directly above TabBar)
- Removed gap between PlaybackBar and TabBar (was 88px, changed to 80px to match TabBar height)
- Added null safety check in PlaybackBar: `if (!track) return null;`
- Made TabBar `position: fixed` with proper z-index layering

## Tomorrow's Recommended Priorities
1. **Monitor tester feedback** - Watch for bugs or UX issues - Est: Ongoing
2. **Test on physical device** - Verify all new features work in production - Est: 1 hour
3. **Address any tester-reported bugs** - Fix issues as they arise - Est: TBD
4. **Continue App Store prep** - Screenshots, description, privacy policy (from 2025-10-05 EOD) - Est: 2 hours

## Notes for Next Session
- All work successfully committed and merged to master
- Build ready to be pushed to testers
- Branch `playlist-sharing-fixes` created from recovered detached HEAD commits
- Minor uncommitted changes: deleted/new screenshots, Xcode project file modifications
- Ready for tester feedback and next iteration

### Session Context
- Continued from previous session that ran out of context
- Successfully recovered and merged 2 commits that were on detached HEAD
- User's goal: Push build to testers for feedback on new features

### Features Ready for Testing
✅ Deep link playlist sharing (coretet:// scheme)
✅ Playlist filter toggle (My Playlists / Following)
✅ Ownership-based edit controls
✅ Auto-play next track
✅ iOS keyboard viewport fix
✅ Fixed PlaybackBar/TabBar positioning

## User Experience Improvements
### Before This Session
- ❌ Keyboard created black space and broke viewport
- ❌ TabBar disappeared on certain screens
- ❌ Deep link navigation caused infinite loop
- ❌ Followed playlists mixed with created playlists
- ❌ Users could edit playlists they don't own
- ❌ Tracks didn't auto-advance when finished
- ❌ Gap visible between PlaybackBar and TabBar

### After This Session
- ✅ Keyboard opens/closes smoothly without viewport issues
- ✅ TabBar always visible with fixed positioning
- ✅ Deep links work correctly (process launch URL only once)
- ✅ Clear separation: "My Playlists" vs "Following"
- ✅ Edit controls only available for owned playlists
- ✅ Seamless auto-play through playlist/track list
- ✅ Clean UI with no gaps between components

## Technical Insights
### React Event Listener Gotcha
**Problem**: Event listeners in React capture state values at creation time.

**Example**:
```typescript
// This won't work - currentTrack will always be undefined
audioRef.current.addEventListener('ended', () => {
  playNextTrack(currentTrack); // currentTrack captured at listener creation
});
```

**Solution**: Use `useRef` to hold mutable values that event listeners can access:
```typescript
const currentTrackRef = useRef<any | null>(null);

// Update ref whenever state changes
setCurrentTrack(targetTrack);
currentTrackRef.current = targetTrack;

// Event listener accesses ref (always current)
audioRef.current.addEventListener('ended', () => {
  const track = currentTrackRef.current; // Gets latest value
  playNextTrack(track);
});
```

### iOS Viewport Management
- `viewport-fit=cover` extends content to screen edges but causes keyboard viewport bugs
- Trade-off: Either have edge-to-edge content OR reliable keyboard behavior
- For keyboard-heavy apps, reliability > aesthetics
- `position: fixed` on body element interferes with iOS viewport calculations

## AI Tool Performance
- **Copilot Effectiveness**: N/A - not used this session
- **Claude Code Effectiveness**: 5/5 - Excellent performance
  - Successfully debugged complex React event listener state capture issue
  - Identified and fixed navigation loop with proper use of useRef
  - Implemented comprehensive playlist filtering and ownership permissions
  - Merged detached HEAD commits without data loss
  - Clear explanations of iOS viewport trade-offs
- **Coordination Issues**: None

## Session Highlights
🎯 **Major Achievement**: Complete playlist sharing workflow with deep links
🐛 **Critical Bugs Fixed**: Event listener state capture, navigation loop, keyboard viewport
✨ **UX Enhancements**: Playlist filters, ownership controls, auto-play
📱 **iOS Improvements**: Stable keyboard behavior, fixed TabBar/PlaybackBar positioning
🔀 **Git Recovery**: Successfully merged commits from detached HEAD state
