- **Duration**: ~9:00 AM - 4:39 PM (approx 7.5 hours)
- **Primary Focus**: iOS App Deployment & Bug Fixes for MVP Testing
- **Branch**: master

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Fixed authentication profile loading - resolved `user` variable reference error in MainDashboard
- [x] Implemented cloud storage file upload - Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud access via native iOS file picker
- [x] Added iOS permissions and entitlements for file access (Info.plist, App.entitlements)
- [x] Fixed app icon alpha channel issue - removed transparency for App Store validation
- [x] Successfully uploaded app to App Store Connect via TestFlight

- [x] Configured deep linking for app-only sharing (coretet:// URL scheme)
- [x] Data migration - moved playlists/tracks from phone auth user to email auth user

## In Progress
- [ ] TestFlight build processing - 100% uploaded, waiting for Apple processing (10-30 min)
  - Current state: Build uploaded successfully, awaiting "ready to submit" email
  - Next steps: Complete Export Compliance, add internal testers

## Blocked Items
None currently

## New Discoveries
### Tasks Added
- [ ] Implement Universal Links for better sharing UX - Priority: LOW (post-MVP)
  - Current `coretet://` links only work if app installed
  - Future: `https://coretet.com/playlist/ABC` should open app if installed, web page if not
- [ ] Replace placeholder app icon with branded design - Priority: MEDIUM
  - Current: Solid blue placeholder (no alpha channel)
  - Need: 1024x1024 CoreTet branded icon
- [ ] Prepare App Store listing metadata - Priority: HIGH
  - Screenshots (3-10 required, various iPhone sizes)
  - App description
  - Privacy Policy URL
  - Keywords for search

### Issues Found
None - all discovered issues were fixed during session

## Code Health Metrics
- **Files Modified**: 26 files
- **Lines Added/Removed**: +3,165 / -1,568 (net +1,597)
- **Test Coverage**: N/A (not measured this session)
- **New Tech Debt**:
  - TODO markers: 0 added
  - FIXME markers: 0 added
  - AI-REVIEW pending: 0 added

## Key Technical Changes
### Authentication System
- Switched from Clerk to Supabase password auth (email + password)
- Fixed blank profile loading by correcting `user` ‚Üí `currentUser` references
- Migrated user data between auth methods via SQL

### File Upload System
- Implemented `@capawesome/capacitor-file-picker` plugin
- Native iOS file picker accesses Files app (Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud)
- Added proper iOS permissions: NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription, UISupportsDocumentBrowser
- Created App.entitlements for iCloud access
- **Note**: File picker doesn't work in iOS simulator - requires physical device

### Audio Player Improvements
- Fixed Howler.js soundId tracking to enable proper pause/resume
- Added touch event handlers with preventDefault/stopPropagation for smooth seeking
- Progress bar now supports both tap and drag gestures on mobile

### iOS Deployment
- Resolved app icon alpha channel validation error
- Created RGB (no transparency) placeholder icon using Python
- Configured code signing and provisioning in Xcode
- Successfully archived and uploaded to App Store Connect

## Tomorrow's Recommended Priorities
1. Complete TestFlight setup - Add internal testers, complete Export Compliance - Est: 30 min
2. Test updated build on physical device - Verify pause/resume and progress bar fixes - Est: 1 hour
3. Create branded app icon (1024x1024, no transparency) - Est: 2 hours
4. Prepare App Store metadata - Screenshots, description, privacy policy - Est: 2 hours
5. Begin external tester beta program - Est: 1 hour

## Notes for Next Session
- Build #1 uploaded to App Store Connect, awaiting processing
- All code changes are uncommitted (working directory has extensive modifications)
- No commits made today - all work in progress
- iOS project files created: `ios/App/App.xcodeproj/`, `ios/App/App.xcworkspace/`
- New files need git add: PhoneAuthScreen, PublicPlaylistView, deepLinkHandler, nativeFilePicker, PlaylistContext

### Environment Notes
- Running on macOS with Xcode
- Using physical iPhone for testing (simulator has file picker limitations)
- Capacitor 7.x, React 18, Vite 4, Supabase client 2.58

## Update Publishing Process Learned
- **All iOS updates must go through Apple** - no over-the-air updates
- Process: Fix bugs ‚Üí Increment build number ‚Üí Archive ‚Üí Upload ‚Üí TestFlight
- TestFlight: Immediate access after processing (~10-30 min)
- App Store: 1-2 day review for public release
- Testers must install TestFlight app to receive beta builds

## AI Tool Performance
- **Copilot Effectiveness**: N/A - not used this session
- **Claude Code Effectiveness**: 5/5 - Excellent performance
  - Successfully debugged multiple complex issues (auth, file picker, audio player)
  - Handled iOS-specific tooling (sips, Python for icon generation)
  - Navigated Capacitor/Xcode/App Store Connect workflow effectively
  - Provided clear explanations of iOS deployment process
- **Coordination Issues**: None

## Session Highlights
