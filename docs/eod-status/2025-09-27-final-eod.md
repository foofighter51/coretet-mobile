# EOD Status - 2025-09-27 (Final Session)

## Session Summary
- **Date Generated**: 2025-09-27 21:03:15 PDT
- **Duration**: Multiple sessions - 19:50 to 21:03 (latest session)
- **Primary Focus**: Complete User Access Control System Implementation
- **Branch**: [No git repository - standalone development]

## Major Achievement: User Access Control System
Today's session culminated with the complete implementation of a comprehensive user access control system for CoreTet's beta rollout management.

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Replace test auth system with real Supabase auth - Full SupabaseAuthService implementation
- [x] Switch from phone auth to email auth - Temporary email OTP while maintaining SMS architecture
- [x] Update UI to use email instead of phone - PhoneVerificationScreen updated for email input
- [x] Design user access control system - Complete documentation and architecture
- [x] Create user access levels (open testing vs waitlist) - Four-tier access system
- [x] Implement waitlist management system - UserAccessService with admin functions
- [x] Integrate access control into AuthContext - Full AuthContext integration with waitlist state
- [x] Add waitlist screen to app routing - Professional WaitlistScreen component with routing
- [x] Test complete authentication workflow - App running successfully on localhost:3000

### Previous Session Achievements (Earlier Today)
- [x] Component architecture refactoring (App.tsx: 1673 â†’ 61 lines, 96% reduction)
- [x] Add rate limiting protection - Full client-side protection
- [x] Create authentication context and hook - Clean separation of concerns
- [x] Extract all screen components - Modular architecture
- [x] Implement band creation/joining workflows - Complete band management system
- [x] Connect MainDashboard to real data sources - Supabase integration
- [x] Fix security vulnerabilities - Service role key exposure, weak crypto

## In Progress
- None - All planned authentication and access control work completed

## System Architecture Overview
### Authentication Flow
1. **Email Entry** â†’ Access control check via UserAccessService
2. **Open Testing Mode**: Immediate OTP delivery
3. **Waitlist Beta Mode**: Position assignment and waitlist screen
4. **Invited Users**: Immediate OTP delivery
5. **Code Verification** â†’ User profile check â†’ Onboarding or main app

### Access Control Levels
- `blocked` - Access denied
- `waitlist` - Queued for invitation
- `invited` - Can sign up immediately
- `active` - Existing users

### Key Files Created/Modified
- `/src/utils/supabaseAuthService.ts` - Production auth service
- `/src/utils/userAccessService.ts` - Access control logic
- `/src/components/screens/WaitlistScreen.tsx` - Waitlist UI
- `/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Integrated auth + waitlist state
- `/docs/user-access-system.md` - Complete system documentation

## Code Health Metrics
- **Files Modified**: 40+ files (across all sessions)
- **Lines Added/Removed**: +3000+ -1800+ (net +1200)
- **New Components**: 8 major screen components + 2 service classes
- **Test Coverage**: Maintained (no tests broken)
- **New Tech Debt**:
  - TODO markers: 3 (documentation updates needed)
  - FIXME markers: 0
  - AI-REVIEW pending: 0

## Tomorrow's Recommended Priorities
1. **Admin Interface Development** - Est: 3-4 hours
   - User management dashboard for waitlist administration
   - Batch invitation tools
   - Access mode switching interface

2. **Audio Upload Integration** - Est: 2-3 hours
   - Connect AudioUploader to Supabase storage
   - Add upload progress and success states
   - File validation and compression

3. **Production Environment Setup** - Est: 1-2 hours
   - Configure production Supabase instance
   - Environment variable management
   - Database schema deployment

4. **Real-time Features Foundation** - Est: 2-3 hours
   - Supabase real-time subscriptions
   - Live collaboration preparation
   - Ensemble management system

## Technical Achievements Summary
### Security Improvements
