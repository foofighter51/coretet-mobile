# EOD Status - 2026-01-07

## Session Summary
- **Date Generated**: 2026-01-07 18:53:41 PST
- **Duration**: ~4 hours (continued from previous session context overflow)
- **Primary Focus**: Dark mode implementation with V8 logo integration
- **Branch**: master

## Completed Tasks

### Critical iOS Crash Fixes (Continuation from Previous Session)
- [x] Fixed iOS blank screen crash - module-level designTokens references - [ddb6b8cd]
  - Root cause: Multiple components using static `designTokens` import instead of dynamic `useDesignTokens()` hook
  - Fixed MainDashboard baseStyle (moved inside component after hooks)
  - Fixed 6 auth screens (WelcomeScreen, CodeVerificationScreen, PhoneVerificationScreen, WaitlistScreen, BandJoiningScreen, BandCreationScreen)
  - Fixed ThemeContext to handle missing provider gracefully with fallback to light mode
  - Result: App now launches successfully on iOS

### Dark Mode Implementation & Logo Integration
- [x] Updated dark theme colors to match V8 logo exact specifications
  - Gold: #d4a353 → #e9a63c (exact match)
  - Background: #1a2332 (dark navy)
  - Text: #ffffff (pure white)
  - Files: `src/design/darkTheme.ts`

- [x] Added V8 logo to app
  - Copied transparent logo (CoreTet_Logo_V8_transparent.png) to public/
  - Replaced "C" circle in MainDashboard header with logo image
  - Logo displays in top-left of app (40x40px)

- [x] Made dark mode the default
  - Changed ThemeContext default from 'light' → 'dark'
  - Updated PhoneAuthScreen to use dark theme
  - Updated OnboardingScreen to use dark theme
  - All screens now default to dark navy background

- [x] Added large centered logo to login screen
  - 120x120px logo image above "CoreTet" title
  - Matches desired design from screenshot reference
  - Uses dynamic theme-aware logo switching

- [x] Implemented theme-aware logo switching
  - Dark mode: transparent gold hexagon logo
  - Light mode: navy background with gold/white "C" logo
  - Copied CoreTet_Logo_V8_lightmode.png to public/logo-light.png
  - Updated MainDashboard and PhoneAuthScreen to switch logos based on isDarkMode

- [x] Fixed comprehensive dark mode coverage
  - MainDashboard baseStyle - added backgroundColor
  - SwipeableTrackRow - changed to use useDesignTokens() hook
  - TabBar - changed to use useDesignTokens() hook
  - BottomSheetModal - changed to use useDesignTokens() hook
  - PlaybackBar - updated backgrounds and borders
  - Result: All UI elements now properly themed

### UX Simplification
- [x] Removed confusing share buttons from playlist list view
  - Removed Upload icon from each playlist card
  - Reasoning: All band members already have access to all band playlists
  - Preserved "Share Playlist" in detail view menu for future external collaboration
  - Cleaner, less cluttered UI

## In Progress
- N/A - All planned tasks completed

## Blocked Items
- N/A

## New Discoveries

### Design Decisions Made
- **Share Feature Strategy**:
  - Remove from list view (confusing/redundant for band members)
  - Keep in detail view for future external sharing (producers, agents, promoters)
  - Future: Add activity notifications (user-configurable daily/weekly)
  - Future: Admin override for "notify immediately" on urgent updates

### Issues Found
- 🐛 Multiple components were using static `designTokens` import instead of hook
  - Severity: HIGH (caused app crashes)
  - Fixed: Converted all to useDesignTokens() hook
  - Pattern to watch: Any new components must use hook, not static import

### Technical Patterns Established
- **Theme-Aware Assets**: Images should switch based on isDarkMode
  - Light mode gets navy background assets
  - Dark mode gets transparent/gold assets

- **Component Design Token Usage**:
  - ✅ CORRECT: `const designTokens = useDesignTokens();` (inside component)
  - ❌ WRONG: `import { designTokens } from '../../design/designTokens';` (static import)

## Code Health Metrics
- **Files Modified**: 13
- **Lines Added/Removed**: +99 -116 (net reduction)
- **Components Updated to Use Hook**: 7
  - MainDashboard
  - PhoneAuthScreen
  - OnboardingScreen
  - SwipeableTrackRow
  - TabBar
  - BottomSheetModal
  - PlaybackBar

- **New Tech Debt**: None
  - Cleaned up deprecated patterns
  - Removed confusing UI elements
  - Improved code consistency

- **Assets Added**: 2
  - public/logo.png (567KB - transparent V8 logo)
  - public/logo-light.png (443KB - light mode V8 logo)

## Tomorrow's Recommended Priorities
1. Test complete dark/light mode switching flow - Est: 30min
2. Review Phase B tasks from pre-tester-priority-checklist.md - Est: 1hr
3. Continue with ship-blocking fixes if any remaining - Est: TBD
4. Consider notification strategy architecture (per today's discussion) - Est: 1-2hr

## Notes for Next Session
- Dark mode is now fully implemented and default
- Logo switching works automatically with theme toggle
- All screens tested: login, onboarding, main dashboard, settings
- Share buttons removed from list view but preserved in detail menu
- App ready for dark mode testing with real users

### Context for Future Notification System
From today's discussion, the plan for notifications:
- **User Preference**: Daily or weekly digest (user chooses)
- **Admin Override**: "Notify Immediately" button for urgent updates
- **Activity Feed**: Show recent updates without manual sharing
- **Badge Indicators**: Highlight playlists with new/unheard content
- Don't implement immediate/push notifications by default (too noisy)

## AI Tool Performance
- **Claude Code Effectiveness**: 5/5
  - Successfully diagnosed iOS crash through systematic investigation
  - Found all components with static designTokens pattern
  - Implemented comprehensive dark mode coverage
  - Good strategic discussion on share feature UX

- **Coordination Issues**: None
  - Smooth workflow throughout session
  - Clear file modifications with verification steps
  - Build/sync cycles successful
