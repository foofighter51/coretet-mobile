- [x] App icon & splash screen generation - Python script with CoreTet branding
- [x] Removed redundant Clerk UserButton from header - Sign out available in Profile tab

## In Progress
- [ ] iOS deployment preparation - 95% complete
  - Current state: App builds and runs in simulator with proper safe areas
  - Next steps: Production build configuration, App Store submission prep

## New Discoveries
### Tasks Added
- [ ] Remove the database migration SQL execution requirement - Priority: LOW
  - Currently user needs to manually run: `ALTER TABLE tracks ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS folder_path TEXT;`
  - Should automate or handle via Supabase migrations

- [ ] Implement post-MVP features (from user prioritization):
  1. [ ] Remove tracks from playlist - Priority: HIGH
  2. [ ] Playlist rename/delete (edit menu) - Priority: MED
  3. [ ] Multi-select track management - Priority: MED
  4. [ ] Track soft-delete with 30-day recycle bin - Priority: LOW

### Issues Found
- üêõ TypeScript compilation issues in build process - Severity: MED
  - Location: npm build script fails on tsc, had to use `npx vite build` directly
  - Temporary workaround: Skip tsc and build with vite directly for production

- üêõ CocoaPods not installed by default - Severity: LOW
  - Required manual Ruby 3.4.6 installation via Homebrew
  - Required manual pod install with proper PATH configuration

## Code Health Metrics
- **Files Modified**: 23
- **Lines Added/Removed**: +2747 -1194 (net +1553 lines)
- **Test Coverage**: N/A (no tests written this session)
- **New Tech Debt**:
  - TODO markers: 0 added
  - FIXME markers: 0 added
  - AI-REVIEW pending: 0

## Major Technical Achievements
1. **Full iOS Native App Integration**
   - Capacitor configured with dev server for live reload
   - iOS safe areas properly implemented (notch, home indicator)
   - Custom app icon and branded splash screen

2. **Complete Sharing Flow**
   - React Router integration with public/private routes
   - Share code generation and public playlist views
   - No-auth public access for shared playlists

3. **MVP Feature Completion**
   - Rating filters with persistent state
   - Folder organization with visual badges
   - Clean mobile-first layout

## Tomorrow's Recommended Priorities
1. Production iOS build setup - Est: 2-3 hours
   - Remove dev server config from capacitor.config.ts
   - Create production build with `npm run build`
   - Configure Xcode signing & capabilities
   - Test production build on simulator

2. Post-MVP Feature: Remove tracks from playlist - Est: 2-4 hours
   - Add multi-select checkbox system
   - Implement delete from playlist_items
   - Maintain proper position ordering

3. Database migration automation - Est: 1 hour
   - Ensure folder_path migration runs automatically
   - Verify all migrations are tracked in version control

## Notes for Next Session
- Development server still running on localhost:3000
- Capacitor config currently points to dev server (needs removal for production)
- CocoaPods PATH: `/opt/homebrew/lib/ruby/gems/3.4.0/bin/pod`
- Xcode workspace: `ios/App/App.xcworkspace` (NOT .xcodeproj)
- All uncommitted changes in working directory - consider committing major milestones

## AI Tool Performance
- **Copilot Effectiveness**: N/A - Not used this session
- **Claude Code Effectiveness**: 5/5
  - Excellent troubleshooting for Xcode workspace issues
  - Efficient CocoaPods installation with Ruby version resolution
  - Clean iOS safe area implementation
  - Helpful asset generation with Python/Pillow
- **Coordination Issues**: None - Single AI workflow

## Key Environment Setup
- Ruby 3.4.6 via Homebrew: `/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin`
- CocoaPods: Installed via gem, requires PATH addition
- Python venv: `.venv/` for asset generation scripts
- Capacitor dev config: `server.url = http://localhost:3000`

- `src/components/screens/PublicPlaylistView.tsx` - Public playlist sharing view
- `src/components/molecules/PlaybackBar.tsx` - Persistent audio playback control
- `src/components/molecules/SwipeableTrackRow.tsx` - Track row with rating UI
- `src/contexts/PlaylistContext.tsx` - Playlist state management

**Configuration:**
- `capacitor.config.ts` - iOS app configuration
- `ios/App/` - Complete iOS native project structure
- `scripts/generate-app-assets.py` - App icon & splash screen generator
