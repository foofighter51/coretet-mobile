# CoreTet Development Status - October 9, 2025 (Afternoon EOD)

## Session Summary
Implemented basic commenting system, redesigned Track Detail Modal as centered overlay, added iOS safe area support, and built comprehensive tutorial system for user onboarding.

## Completed Features

### Basic Commenting System
- **Comment Creation**: Text input with "Post" button in Track Detail Modal
- **Comment Display**: Shows all comments with username, timestamp, and content
- **Real-time Updates**: Comments refresh after posting
- **Enter Key Support**: Press Enter to submit comment
- **Loading States**: "Loading comments..." while fetching
- **Empty State**: "No comments yet. Be the first to comment!"
- **Sort Order**: Comments sorted by newest first (`created_at DESC`)

**Database Integration:**
- Uses existing `db.comments.create()` and `db.comments.getByTrack()` API
- Fetches user profile names alongside comments
- Comment model: track_id, user_id, content, created_at

### Track Detail Modal Redesign
- **Centered Overlay**: Changed from bottom sheet to centered modal
  - `alignItems: 'center'` instead of `'flex-end'`
  - `borderRadius: xl` on all sides (not just top)
  - `maxHeight: 85vh` with padding around edges
  - Modal no longer covers PlaybackBar/TabBar

- **Text Selection Disabled**:
  - Added `userSelect: 'none'` and `WebkitUserSelect: 'none'`
  - Prevents iOS context menu (Copy, Look Up, Translate) during long-press
  - Fixes random text selection issue

- **Space-Efficient Layout**:
  - Duration moved inline with track title (removed separate info box)
  - Rater names inline with rating type (e.g., "Listened Eric" on one line)
  - Reduced padding and icon sizes for compactness
  - Rating cards: changed from vertical stack to horizontal inline layout

**Before/After Comparison:**
- Header: Track title + close button ‚Üí Track title + duration + close button
- Ratings: Icon + "Listened" + "Eric" (3 lines) ‚Üí Icon "Listened" Eric (1 line)
- Space savings: ~60px per rating card, more room for comments

### iOS Safe Area Support
- **Problem**: Header "creeping up" into iOS notch/status bar after extended use
- **Solution**: Added `paddingTop: 'env(safe-area-inset-top, 0px)'` to fixed header
- **Result**: Header content always appears below status bar/notch, Back button always accessible

**Technical Details:**
- CSS environment variable `env(safe-area-inset-top)` provided by iOS
- Fallback `0px` for devices without notch or web
- Prevents layout recalculation issues from keyboard/system events

### Share Icon Update
- **Changed**: Triangle icon (`Share2`) ‚Üí Box-with-arrow icon (`Upload`)
- **Matches**: iOS/universal share icon standard (box with arrow pointing up-right)
- **Error Fix**: `Share` doesn't exist in lucide-react v0.263.1, used `Upload` instead
- **Locations Updated**:
  - Playlist list view share button
  - Three-dot menu "Share Playlist" option

### Share Button Visibility
- **Hidden for Following Tab**: Share button only shows for owned playlists
- **Condition**: `{playlistFilter === 'mine' && (<Upload button/>)}`
- **Result**: Users can't share playlists they don't own

### Tutorial System (New Feature)
Built comprehensive 7-step interactive tutorial for user onboarding.

**Tutorial Steps:**
1. **Welcome to CoreTet** - Introduction to collaboration features
2. **Upload Your Tracks** - How to add audio files
   - üí° Tip: Download from Google Drive/Dropbox via iOS Files app first
3. **Create Playlists** - How to organize tracks into playlists
4. **Share with Bandmates** - How to share playlists via share links
5. **Rate Tracks** - How to use swipe-to-rate (listened/liked/loved)
   - üí° Tip: Gray icons = others' ratings, colored = your rating
6. **Add Comments** - How to long-press for Track Detail Modal
7. **Send Feedback** - How to use Community Feedback system

**Tutorial Features:**
- Modal overlay with dark background (z-index 2000)
- Previous/Next navigation with disabled states
- Progress dots (1 / 7)
- Icon for each step (Upload, List, Share, Star, MessageSquare, etc.)
- Tip boxes for steps 2 & 5 with helpful hints
- Close button (X) in top-right
- Text selection disabled
- Centered, scrollable layout (max 500px width, 80vh height)
- "Get Started" button on final step

**Access Point:**
- Profile tab ‚Üí "How to Use CoreTet" button
- Button style: Light gray background, blue border, HelpCircle icon
- Positioned above "Community Feedback" button

**Implementation:**
- New component: `src/components/molecules/Tutorial.tsx` (254 lines)
- Added `showTutorial` state to MainDashboard
- Imported HelpCircle icon from lucide-react
- Tutorial overlays all other content including modals

const tutorialSteps: TutorialStep[] = [
  { title: 'Welcome to CoreTet', content: '...' },
  // 7 steps total with icons and optional tips
];

export function Tutorial({ onClose }: TutorialProps) {
  const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState(0);
  // Navigation logic, progress dots, modal overlay
}
```

## Architecture Notes

### Comment System Flow
1. Long-press track ‚Üí Track Detail Modal opens
2. Modal fetches ratings + comments via parallel requests
3. User types comment, presses Enter or "Post"
4. `handleSubmitComment()` calls `db.comments.create()`
5. Fetches updated comments with profile names
6. Comment list refreshes with new comment at top

### Tutorial Design Pattern
- Self-contained component with internal step navigation
- Array-based content structure for easy maintenance
- Progress tracking via state index
- Overlay pattern with click-outside-to-close
- Reusable for future onboarding flows

### Safe Area Implementation
- Uses CSS environment variables for iOS insets
- Applied at header level (not entire app)
- Allows content to flow naturally while protecting interactive elements
- Fallback for non-iOS devices (0px)

## Performance Considerations
- Tutorial component lazy-renders only when needed
- Comments fetched per-track (not all at once)
- Profile names fetched via `Promise.all` for parallel loading
- Modal overlays use fixed positioning (no layout thrashing)

## Design Decisions

**Why centered modal vs bottom sheet?**
- Bottom sheet covered PlaybackBar/TabBar (user frustration)
- Centered modal feels more intentional/focused
- Better use of vertical space on larger screens

**Why Upload icon instead of Share icon?**
- `Share` doesn't exist in lucide-react v0.263.1
- `Upload` (box with arrow) matches iOS share icon visually
- Universally recognizable share metaphor

**Why hide share on Following tab?**
- Users don't own these playlists (they're following them)
- Can't modify or manage sharing settings
- Reduces UI clutter and confusion

**Why tutorial in Profile tab?**
- Profile is about user settings/preferences
- Natural place for help/support features
- Near Community Feedback for related discovery
- Not intrusive to primary workflows (tracks/playlists)

## Code Quality Notes
- Maintained design token consistency throughout
- Added proper TypeScript types for tutorial steps
- Reused existing modal pattern for tutorial overlay
- Comments properly integrated with existing database API
- No breaking changes to existing features

## User Feedback Integration
Throughout session, user provided screenshots to identify:
- Text selection issue during long-press
- Share icon preference (box-with-arrow style)
- Share button showing on followed playlists
- Safe area "creep up" bug

All issues addressed with targeted fixes.

## Documentation
- Tutorial system is self-documenting via step content
- Code comments added for safe area implementation
- Tip boxes in tutorial explain advanced features (cloud upload, rating aggregation)

## Next Session Prep
- User indicated tutorial tweaks needed
- Consider: tutorial auto-show on first launch
- Consider: tutorial skip/restart functionality
- Consider: tutorial step highlighting of actual UI elements
- Potential: Add "Restart Tutorial" button in Profile
