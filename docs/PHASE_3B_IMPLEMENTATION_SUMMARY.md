# Phase 3B Implementation Summary

## Overview

Phase 3B adds a complete band invite system that allows band admins to invite users to join their bands. The implementation includes database setup, RLS policies, API functions, and three UI components.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema & RLS Policies

**Location:** [docs/PHASE_3B_DATABASE_SETUP.md](PHASE_3B_DATABASE_SETUP.md)

Created `band_invites` table with:
- Unique invite tokens (UUID)
- 7-day expiration
- Status tracking (pending/accepted/expired/revoked)
- Email validation
- Duplicate invite prevention

RLS policies ensure:
- Only admins can create invites
- Only admins can revoke pending invites
- Anyone with valid token can view invite (for acceptance)
- Authenticated users can accept invites

### 2. API Functions

**Location:** [lib/supabase.ts](../lib/supabase.ts#L737-L931)

Added `db.bandInvites` namespace with:
- `create(bandId, invitedBy, invitedEmail)` - Generate unique invite token
- `getByToken(token)` - Fetch invite details for acceptance page
- `accept(token, userId)` - Join band and update invite status
- `revoke(inviteId)` - Delete pending invite
- `listPendingForBand(bandId)` - List active invites for band

### 3. UI Components

#### BandSettings Modal
**Location:** [src/components/molecules/BandSettings.tsx](../src/components/molecules/BandSettings.tsx)

Features:
- Band info display (name, member count)
- Members list with roles (owner/admin/member badges)
- "Invite New Member" button (admins only)
- Pending invites list with revoke option
- Clean, modal-based design

#### CreateInvite Modal
**Location:** [src/components/molecules/CreateInvite.tsx](../src/components/molecules/CreateInvite.tsx)

Features:
- Email address input with validation
- Generate unique invite link
- Copy to clipboard
- iOS share sheet integration
- Success/error messaging
- Two-step flow: generate → share

#### AcceptInvite Screen
**Location:** [src/components/screens/AcceptInvite.tsx](../src/components/screens/AcceptInvite.tsx)

Features:
- Full-page accept invite screen
- Shows band name and inviter info
- Loading states
- Error handling (invalid/expired invites)
- Success animation
- Auto-redirect to Band tab after acceptance
- Requires authentication

### 4. MainDashboard Integration

**Location:** [src/components/screens/MainDashboard.tsx](../src/components/screens/MainDashboard.tsx)

Changes:
- Added Settings icon import
- Added `showBandSettings` state
- Added gear icon button in header (Band tab, list view, admins only)
- Renders BandSettings modal when opened
- Uses `userRole` from BandContext to check admin status

### 5. Routing

**Location:** [src/App.tsx](../src/App.tsx)

Added route:
- `/invite/:token` - AcceptInvite screen (requires authentication)
- Wrapped in BandProvider for context access

## User Flow

### Inviting Users (Admin)

1. Admin taps **Settings** gear icon in Band tab
2. Taps **"Invite New Member"** button
3. Enters email address
4. Taps **"Generate Invite Link"**
5. System creates unique invite with token
6. Admin can:
   - Copy link to clipboard
   - Share via iOS share sheet
7. Invite appears in "Pending Invites" section
8. Admin can revoke invite anytime

### Accepting Invites (Invitee)

1. Invitee receives invite link (via message, email, etc.)
2. Opens link: `https://coretet.app/invite/{token}`
3. If not logged in → Prompted to sign up/login
4. If logged in → Sees "Join Band" screen with:
   - Band name
   - Inviter name
5. Taps **"Join Band"**
6. Added to `band_members` table
7. Invite marked as "accepted"
8. Success screen shown
9. Auto-redirected to Band tab (2 seconds)
10. Can now see band content

## Security Features

- **Token-based:** UUIDs are cryptographically random (impossible to guess)
- **Expiration:** Invites expire after 7 days
- **RLS enforcement:** Database-level security
- **Admin-only creation:** Only admins/owners can invite
- **Single-use:** Accepted invites cannot be reused
- **Email validation:** Prevents invalid emails
- **Duplicate prevention:** Can't invite existing members
- **No pending duplicates:** One active invite per email per band

## Testing Checklist

Before testing, ensure database schema is applied:

1. **Apply Database Setup**
   - Copy SQL from [docs/PHASE_3B_DATABASE_SETUP.md](PHASE_3B_DATABASE_SETUP.md)
   - Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
   - Run migration
   - Verify with verification query

2. **Test Invite Creation (Admin)**
   - [ ] Settings icon appears in Band tab (admins only)
   - [ ] Settings modal opens and shows band info
   - [ ] Members list displays with correct roles
   - [ ] "Invite New Member" button works
   - [ ] Email validation works (invalid emails rejected)
   - [ ] Invite generation succeeds
   - [ ] Invite link is generated correctly
   - [ ] Copy to clipboard works
   - [ ] iOS share sheet works (native only)
   - [ ] New invite appears in "Pending Invites"

3. **Test Invite Acceptance**
   - [ ] Open invite link in browser or app
   - [ ] If not logged in, prompted to authenticate
   - [ ] Invite details display correctly (band name, inviter)
   - [ ] "Join Band" button works
   - [ ] Success screen shows
   - [ ] Auto-redirect to Band tab works
   - [ ] User now sees band content
   - [ ] User appears in band members list

4. **Test Error Handling**
   - [ ] Invalid token shows error
   - [ ] Expired invite (>7 days) shows error
   - [ ] Already a member shows error
   - [ ] Duplicate invite prevented
   - [ ] Network errors handled gracefully

5. **Test Revoke Functionality**
   - [ ] Admin can see pending invites
   - [ ] Revoke button works
   - [ ] Revoked invite disappears from list
   - [ ] Revoked invite link no longer works

## Known Limitations

1. **No Email Sending:** Invites must be manually shared (no automatic email)
2. **Admin-only Invites:** All invited users become regular members (no role selection)
3. **7-Day Fixed Expiration:** Cannot customize expiration time
4. **No Bulk Invites:** Must create one invite at a time

## Future Enhancements (Not in Phase 3B)

- Email sending integration (via Supabase Auth or SendGrid)
- Role selection during invite (admin vs member)
- Customizable expiration times
- Bulk invite creation
- Invite usage limits per band
- Invite history/audit log

## Files Changed/Created

### Modified
- `lib/supabase.ts` - Added `bandInvites` namespace
- `src/components/screens/MainDashboard.tsx` - Added settings button and modal

## Dependencies

No new npm packages required. Uses existing:
