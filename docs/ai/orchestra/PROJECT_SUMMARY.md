## üöÄ Key Features

### ‚úÖ Intelligent Routing
Orchestrator analyzes your request and automatically delegates to the right agent(s).

### ‚úÖ Context Awareness
Each agent maintains conversation history for contextual responses.

### ‚úÖ Multi-Agent Coordination
Complex requests engage multiple agents working together:
- **Sequential**: Each agent builds on previous work
- **Parallel**: Agents work independently
- **Collaborative**: Agents reference each other

### ‚úÖ Flexible Usage
- Use orchestrator for automatic routing
- Access agents directly when you know exactly what you need
- Iterative refinement through conversation

### ‚úÖ Domain Expertise
Each agent is specialized with deep knowledge of:
- Your music app's specific requirements
- Industry best practices
- Appropriate tools and libraries
- Common pitfalls and solutions

---

## üí° How to Use It

### Pattern 1: Simple Question
```python
orchestrator = MusicAppOrchestrator()
response = orchestrator.process_request("What audio format should I use?")
# Automatically routes to AudioAgent
```

### Pattern 2: Feature Development
```python
response = orchestrator.process_request("""
    Design and implement the version tracking feature.
    Include UI design, database schema, API, and mobile code.
""")
# Routes to: UIUXAgent ‚Üí DataAgent ‚Üí BackendAgent ‚Üí MobileAgent
```

### Pattern 3: Iterative Refinement
```python
orchestrator.process_request("Design the rating system")
orchestrator.process_request("Add separate ratings for songwriting and production")
orchestrator.process_request("Give me the React Native code")
# Maintains context across questions
```

### Pattern 4: Direct Agent Access
```python
audio_agent = orchestrator.agents["audio"]
result = audio_agent.execute("Best library for waveform visualization?")
# When you know exactly which agent you need
```

---

## üéº Your Music App Context
