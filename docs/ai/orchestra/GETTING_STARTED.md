# 🚀 Getting Started - Quick Checklist

## ✅ Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install anthropic python-dotenv
   ```

2. **Set API Key**
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-key-here'
   # Or create .env file with: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here
   ```

3. **Run Setup Script**
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```

4. **Verify Installation**
   - Setup script will test the orchestrator
   - You should see: "✅ Setup complete!"

## 🎯 First Steps

### Option 1: Try Examples (Recommended)
```bash
python music_app_examples.py
```
- Choose a scenario (1-9)
- Or select 'i' for interactive mode
- Ask questions about your app

### Option 2: Quick Test
```python
from music_app_orchestrator import MusicAppOrchestrator

orchestrator = MusicAppOrchestrator()
response = orchestrator.process_request("Design the main home screen")
print(response)
```

### Option 3: Create Your Own Script
```bash
python my_development_session.py  # Created by setup.py
```
- Edit this file with your own questions
- Build your own development workflow

## 🎼 Your First Session

### 1. Understand Your Data (Day 1)
```python
orchestrator = MusicAppOrchestrator()

# Design the database
response = orchestrator.process_request("""
    Design the complete database schema for:
    - Users and bands
    - Audio tracks with metadata
    - Version relationships
    - Playlists
    - Comments and ratings
    Include relationships and key fields.
""")
```

### 2. Design Key Screens (Day 1-2)
```python
orchestrator.reset_all()

screens = [
    "Main feed/home screen",
    "Track detail with version history", 
    "Audio player with waveform",
    "Playlist management"
]

for screen in screens:
    response = orchestrator.process_request(f"Design the {screen}")
    # Review and iterate
    orchestrator.reset_all()
```

### 3. Plan Implementation (Day 2-3)
```python
# Choose your stack
orchestrator.process_request("""
    Should I use React Native or Flutter for the mobile app?
    Consider: audio playback, offline support, team expertise,
    and time to market.
""")

# Plan features
orchestrator.process_request("""
    Create an implementation plan for the audio player feature
    including library recommendations and step-by-step tasks.
""")
```

### 4. Build and Deploy (Ongoing)
```python
# Get implementation help
orchestrator.process_request("Implement the audio player in React Native")

# Get deployment help
orchestrator.process_request("Set up production infrastructure on AWS")
```

## 🎯 Agent Quick Reference

| **Need help with...** | **Ask the orchestrator about...** |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Screen design** | "Design the playlist screen" |
| **Audio** | "What format for WIP tracks?" |
| **Database** | "Design the version relationship schema" |
| **API** | "Design REST endpoints for tracks" |
| **Mobile code** | "Implement audio player in React Native" |
| **Sharing** | "Design the sharing permission system" |
| **Security** | "Implement secure authentication" |
| **Deployment** | "Set up production on AWS" |

The orchestrator automatically routes to the right agent(s)!

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Be Specific**
   - ❌ "How do I build this?"
   - ✅ "Design the UI for the track detail screen with version history"

2. **Use Context**
   - Ask follow-up questions
   - Agents remember conversation history
   - Reset with `orchestrator.reset_all()` when changing topics

3. **Request Implementation**
   - Don't stop at design
   - Ask for actual code: "Give me the React Native code"
   - Request step-by-step guides

4. **Iterate**
   - Start broad: "Design the feature"
   - Refine: "Add support for X"
   - Implement: "Give me the code"

5. **Check Task Logs**
   ```python
   orchestrator.get_task_log()  # See which agents were used
   ```

## 🎨 Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: New Feature
```
1. Design UI/UX → orchestrator.process_request("Design...")
2. Model data → orchestrator.process_request("Database schema for...")
3. Design API → orchestrator.process_request("API endpoints for...")
4. Implement → orchestrator.process_request("Implement in React Native...")
5. Secure → orchestrator.process_request("Add authentication...")
6. Deploy → orchestrator.process_request("Deployment strategy...")
```

### Workflow 2: Solve Problem
```
1. Describe problem → orchestrator.process_request("I'm facing issue X...")
2. Get options → "What are my options?"
3. Choose approach → "Let's go with option 2"
4. Get implementation → "Show me how to implement this"
```

### Workflow 3: Learn
```
1. Ask concept → "Explain how WebSockets work for real-time features"
2. See examples → "Show me code examples"
3. Compare → "Compare this to polling, pros and cons"
4. Apply → "How do I use this in our music app?"
```

## 🎵 Your Music App Features

The orchestrator knows about your app:
- **WIP audio sharing** between band members
- **Version tracking** and relationships
- **Timestamped comments** on tracks
- **Collaborative playlists**
- **Familiar music app UX** (Spotify-like)
- **Ratings and feedback system**
- **Mobile-first** (iOS and Android)

## ⚡ Quick Commands

```bash
# Setup
python setup.py

# Interactive examples
python music_app_examples.py

# Your custom session
python my_development_session.py

# Direct Python usage
python
>>> from music_app_orchestrator import MusicAppOrchestrator
>>> orchestrator = MusicAppOrchestrator()
>>> orchestrator.process_request("Your question")
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Module not found"
```bash
pip install anthropic python-dotenv
```

### "API key not set"
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-key'
# Or create .env file
```

### "Agent not routing correctly"
Be more specific in your request. Instead of "build this", say:
- "Design the UI for..."
- "Implement the backend for..."
- "Create the database schema for..."

### "Want more detail"
Ask follow-up questions:
- "Explain that in more detail"
- "Give me the actual code"
- "What are the implementation steps?"

## 🎓 Learning Path

## 🤝 Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Be specific in your requests
- Ask follow-up questions
- Request actual implementation code
- Use context between questions
- Reset when changing topics
- Check which agents were used

❌ **DON'T:**
- Ask vague questions without context
- Expect orchestrator to read your mind
- Forget to reset between unrelated topics
- Skip the documentation
- Hesitate to ask for clarification
