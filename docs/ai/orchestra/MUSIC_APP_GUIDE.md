## üöÄ Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple Question (Single Agent)
```python
orchestrator = MusicAppOrchestrator()

# The orchestrator automatically routes to the right agent
response = orchestrator.process_request(
    "What audio format should I use for WIP tracks?"
)
# Routes to: audio agent
```

### Pattern 2: Feature Design (Multiple Agents)
```python
response = orchestrator.process_request(
    """Design the version tracking feature including:
    - UI/UX for displaying version history
    - Database schema for version relationships
    - API endpoints for version management"""
)
# Routes to: uiux ‚Üí data ‚Üí backend
```

### Pattern 3: Full Feature Implementation
```python
response = orchestrator.process_request(
    """Implement collaborative playlists with real-time updates.
    I need the complete design, database schema, API, mobile code,
    and deployment considerations."""
)
# Routes to: uiux ‚Üí data ‚Üí backend ‚Üí collab ‚Üí mobile ‚Üí devops
```

### Pattern 4: Direct Agent Access
```python
# When you know exactly which agent you need
orchestrator = MusicAppOrchestrator()
audio_agent = orchestrator.agents["audio"]

result = audio_agent.execute(
    "Recommend the best library for waveform visualization in React Native"
)
print(result["result"])
```

### Pattern 5: Iterative Development
```python
orchestrator = MusicAppOrchestrator()

# Initial design
orchestrator.process_request("Design a rating system")

# Refine (maintains context)
orchestrator.process_request("Add separate ratings for songwriting and production")

# Implement (still has context)
orchestrator.process_request("Give me the React Native code for this")

# Reset when switching topics
orchestrator.reset_all()
```

---

## üí° Best Practices

### 1. **Be Specific About Context**
```python
# ‚ùå Vague
"How should I implement comments?"

# ‚úÖ Specific
"Implement a comment system for audio tracks with timestamped comments,
@mentions, and replies. Using React Native."
```

### 2. **Request Multiple Perspectives**
```python
"I'm deciding between React Native and Flutter for the mobile app.
Consider: audio playback requirements, offline support, development speed,
and native performance. What do you recommend?"

# This will engage: mobile, audio, and possibly backend agents
```

### 3. **Break Down Complex Features**
```python
# Instead of one massive request:
orchestrator.process_request("Build the entire app")

# Break it down:
orchestrator.process_request("Design the core data model")
orchestrator.reset_all()
orchestrator.process_request("Design the authentication system")
orchestrator.reset_all()
orchestrator.process_request("Design the audio player interface")
```

### 4. **Use Context Effectively**
```python
# Agents maintain conversation history
orchestrator.process_request("Design the playlist screen")
orchestrator.process_request("How does this integrate with the version tracking?")
# Second question has context from first
```

### 5. **Check Task Logs**
```python
response = orchestrator.process_request("...")

# See which agents were used
for task in orchestrator.get_task_log():
    print(f"{task['agent']}: {task['task']}")
```

---

## üéØ Example Development Workflow

### Week 1: Architecture & Design
```python
orchestrator = MusicAppOrchestrator()

# 1. Define data model
orchestrator.process_request("""
Design the complete database schema for:
- Users and bands
- Audio tracks
- Versions and relationships
- Playlists
- Comments and ratings
""")

# 2. Define API structure
orchestrator.process_request("""
Design the REST API endpoints for all CRUD operations
on the data model we just defined
""")

# 3. Plan security
orchestrator.process_request("""
Design the authentication and permission system
for the API we just designed
""")
```

### Week 2: UI Design
```python
orchestrator.reset_all()

# Design key screens
screens = [
    "Main feed/home screen",
    "Track detail screen with version history",
    "Audio player with waveform",
    "Playlist management screen",
    "User profile and settings"
]

for screen in screens:
    orchestrator.process_request(f"Design the {screen}")
    orchestrator.reset_all()  # Fresh context for each screen
```

### Week 3: Implementation
```python
orchestrator.reset_all()

# Implement core features
orchestrator.process_request("""
Implement the audio player component in React Native with:
- Waveform visualization
- Playback controls
- Background audio support
- Timestamp markers for comments
""")

orchestrator.reset_all()

orchestrator.process_request("""
Implement the version tree visualization showing
relationships between different recordings
""")
```

### Week 4: Deployment
```python
orchestrator.reset_all()

orchestrator.process_request("""
Set up the complete production infrastructure:
- Backend API hosting
- Database
- File storage and CDN
- CI/CD pipeline
- Monitoring
""")
```

## üîß Customization

### Adding a Custom Agent

```python
from music_app_orchestrator import BaseAgent, ClaudeClient

class AnalyticsAgent(BaseAgent):
    """Handles analytics and user tracking"""
    def __init__(self, claude_client: ClaudeClient):
        super().__init__("AnalyticsAgent", claude_client)
    
    def get_system_prompt(self) -> str:
        return """You are an analytics specialist.
        
        Focus on:
        - User behavior tracking
        - Engagement metrics
        - A/B testing
        - Analytics tools (Mixpanel, Amplitude)
        - Privacy-compliant tracking
        
        Context: Music collaboration app analytics"""

# Add to orchestrator
orchestrator = MusicAppOrchestrator()
orchestrator.agents["analytics"] = AnalyticsAgent(orchestrator.client)
```

### Modifying Agent Behavior

```python
# Adjust an existing agent's system prompt
audio_agent = orchestrator.agents["audio"]

# Add project-specific context
custom_prompt = audio_agent.get_system_prompt() + """

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:
- We're targeting iOS and Android
- Files will be mostly 24-bit WAV from Logic Pro and Ableton
- Average file size: 50MB
- Expect 100-1000 concurrent users streaming
"""

# Use in execution
result = audio_agent.execute("Recommend streaming strategy", 
                            context={"custom_prompt": custom_prompt})
```

---

## üìä Agent Communication Patterns

### Sequential (Pipeline)
```
uiux ‚Üí data ‚Üí backend ‚Üí mobile
```
Each agent uses output from previous agent.

**Example**: "Design and implement the playlist feature"

### Parallel (Independent)
```
     ‚îå‚Üí mobile
     ‚îú‚Üí backend
     ‚îî‚Üí devops
```
Agents work independently on different aspects.

**Example**: "I need mobile implementation, API design, and deployment plan"

### Collaborative (Interdependent)
```
collab ‚Üê‚Üí security ‚Üê‚Üí backend
```
Agents reference each other's work.

**Example**: "Design secure sharing with real-time notifications"

## üéì Learning Resources

The orchestrator can help you learn:

```python
# Learning questions
orchestrator.process_request("""
I'm new to React Native. Explain the key concepts I need to know
to build a music player app.
""")

orchestrator.process_request("""
Explain how WebSockets work for real-time features, with examples
specific to collaborative music apps.
""")

orchestrator.process_request("""
Compare different approaches to version tracking in databases,
with pros/cons for each.
""")
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Orchestrator routes to wrong agent
**Solution**: Be more specific in your request
```python
# Instead of: "How do I build this?"
# Say: "Design the UI for..." or "Implement the backend for..."
```

### Issue: Response lacks technical depth
**Solution**: Ask for specific implementation details
```python
"Give me the detailed React Native code with comments"
"Provide SQL schema with indexes and constraints"
```

### Issue: Agents contradict each other
**Solution**: Ask for reconciliation
```python
orchestrator.process_request("""
The backend agent recommended PostgreSQL but the data agent
suggested MongoDB. Help me choose based on our specific needs.
""")
```

---

## üìù Quick Reference

### Common Commands
```python
# Process request
orchestrator.process_request("Your question")

# Reset context
orchestrator.reset_all()

# View task history
orchestrator.get_task_log()

# Direct agent access
orchestrator.agents["uiux"].execute("Question")

# Disable verbose output
orchestrator.process_request("Question", verbose=False)
```
