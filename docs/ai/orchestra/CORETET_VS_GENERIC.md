## 🔑 Key Differences

### Project Context

**Generic:**
```python
"""
Context: Music collaboration app where users:
- Upload and share audio files (generic)
- Create playlists (generic)
- Comment and rate (generic)
- Need to choose tech stack
- Need to design everything
"""
```

**CoreTet:**
```python
"""
PROJECT: CoreTet Band Collaboration App
CODEBASE: ~13,605 lines React/TypeScript

TECH STACK (ALREADY CHOSEN):
- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- Clerk (phone/SMS) - WORKING
- Supabase PostgreSQL

CRITICAL ISSUES:
- RLS disabled (security F)
- 3,000 lines dead code
- Edge Functions bypassed
- API keys exposed
"""
```

### Example Questions

#### Generic Orchestra

**Q:** "Design the authentication system"
**A:** ❌ Suggests OAuth vs. JWT, compares providers, designs from scratch

**Q:** "What database should I use?"
**A:** ❌ Compares PostgreSQL vs MongoDB, suggests schema design

**Q:** "Should I use React Native or Flutter?"
**A:** ❌ Mobile comparison (but you're building web app)

#### CoreTet Orchestra

**Q:** "Fix the authentication issues"
**A:** ✅ "RLS is disabled. Here's SQL to enable it with Clerk-compatible policies..."

**Q:** "What database issues do I have?"
**A:** ✅ "Missing columns: authorized_phone_1-4. Here's the migration..."

**Q:** "How do I improve the UI?"
**A:** ✅ "MainDashboard is 605 lines. Here's how to split it into components..."

## 📋 Agent Specialization Comparison

### Security Agent

**Generic SecurityPrivacyAgent:**
- "Choose authentication system (OAuth, JWT, etc.)"
- "Design permission model"
- "Plan encryption strategy"
- **Problem:** You already have Clerk auth!

**CoreTet SecurityHardeningAgent:**
- "Enable RLS on all tables (currently disabled)"
- "Rotate exposed keys (Clerk, Supabase, Gemini)"
- "Force Edge Function usage (currently bypassed)"
- "Fix UUID collision risk (weak 32-bit hash)"
- **Solution:** Fixes actual security holes!

---

### Architecture Agent

**Generic BackendArchitectureAgent:**
- "Design RESTful API endpoints"
- "Choose between microservices vs monolithic"
- "Select cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure)"
- **Problem:** You already chose Supabase!

**CoreTet ArchitectureRefactorAgent:**
- "Refactor to use Edge Functions (currently bypassed)"
- "Fix direct DB writes from client (insecure)"
- "Split 605-line MainDashboard component"
- "Implement feature-based folder structure"
- **Solution:** Improves existing architecture!

---

### Data Agent

**Generic DataModelingAgent:**
- "Design schema for tracks, versions, playlists"
- "Choose SQL vs NoSQL"
- "Model version relationships"
- **Problem:** Schema already exists!

**CoreTet SchemaIntegrityAgent:**
- "Add missing authorized_phone_1-4 columns"
- "Fix songs.ensemble_id foreign key"
- "Regenerate types from actual schema"
- "Resolve playlist_versions vs playlist_items"
- **Solution:** Fixes schema bugs!

## 🎯 Use Case Examples

### Scenario 1: "I need to improve security"

**Generic:**
1. UIUXAgent designs auth UI
2. SecurityAgent compares auth providers
3. BackendAgent designs API security
4. DevOpsAgent plans secure deployment

**Result:** ❌ Wastes time designing what already exists

**CoreTet:**
1. SecurityHardeningAgent: "RLS disabled - here's SQL to fix"
2. SecurityHardeningAgent: "Keys exposed - rotate immediately"
3. ArchitectureRefactorAgent: "Enable Edge Functions"
4. DeploymentReadinessAgent: "Production security checklist"

**Result:** ✅ Fixes actual security holes

---

### Scenario 2: "The app is slow"

**Generic:**
1. MobileDevAgent optimizes React Native (❌ wrong framework)
2. BackendAgent adds caching (generic advice)
3. AudioAgent compresses files (generic advice)

**Result:** ❌ Mobile-focused, generic solutions

**CoreTet:**
1. UIRefactoringAgent: "MainDashboard recreates inline styles on every render - extract to styled-components"
2. ArchitectureRefactorAgent: "Add lazy loading (currently all screens load eagerly)"
3. AudioOptimizationAgent: "Fix race condition in audioUploadService.ts:117"

**Result:** ✅ Specific fixes for actual performance issues

---

### Scenario 3: "Help me clean up the code"

**Generic:**
1. BackendAgent suggests general refactoring
2. UIUXAgent recommends design patterns

**Result:** ❌ Generic advice

**CoreTet:**
1. CodeCleanupAgent: "Delete these 9 unused Supabase Auth screens (3,000 lines)"
2. CodeCleanupAgent: "Remove AuthContext.tsx - replaced by Clerk"
3. CodeCleanupAgent: "Archive App-original.tsx and docs-App.tsx"
4. SchemaIntegrityAgent: "Fix type mismatches (Band vs Ensemble)"

**Result:** ✅ Specific files to delete with exact paths
