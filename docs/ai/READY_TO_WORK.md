## 🚀 How to Start Working

### Option 1: Interactive Orchestra (Recommended)
```bash
cd docs/ai/orchestra
python start_orchestra.py
```

Choose interactive mode and ask questions like:
- "What should I prioritize today?"
- "How do I enable RLS with Clerk?"
- "What dead code can I delete?"
- "How do I split MainDashboard?"

### Option 2: Command Line
```bash
cd docs/ai/orchestra
python -c "
from coretet_orchestrator import CoreTetOrchestrator
orch = CoreTetOrchestrator()
response = orch.process_request('What is the most critical security issue?')
print(response)
"
```

### Option 3: Python Script
```python
from coretet_orchestrator import CoreTetOrchestrator

orch = CoreTetOrchestrator()

# Ask anything about your codebase
response = orch.process_request("""
    Review the comprehensive review and tell me:
    1. What are the 3 most critical issues?
    2. Which should I tackle first?
    3. How long will each take?
""")

print(response)
```

## 📋 Your Immediate Priorities

### Week 1: Critical Security (USE ORCHESTRA)

**Day 1: API Key Rotation**
```python
orch.process_request("Walk me through rotating all exposed API keys (Clerk, Supabase, Gemini)")
```

**Day 2-3: Enable RLS**
```python
orch.process_request("How do I enable RLS on all tables with Clerk-compatible policies?")
```

**Day 4: Fix UUID Generation**
```python
orch.process_request("Fix the UUID generation collision risk in clerkSupabaseSync.ts")
```

**Day 5: Edge Functions**
```python
orch.process_request("How do I force all database writes through Edge Functions?")
```

### Week 2: Code Cleanup

**Remove Dead Code**
```python
orch.process_request("List all Supabase Auth dead code with exact file paths to delete")
```

**Fix Schema Issues**
```python
orch.process_request("Generate SQL migrations to fix database schema mismatches")
```

**Archive Old Code**
```python
orch.process_request("What should I archive vs delete from the old implementations?")
```

## 🤖 Your 8 Agents (Ready to Help)

### 🔒 SecurityHardeningAgent
**Ask about:** RLS policies, API key rotation, Edge Function security

**Example:**
```python
orch.process_request("Show me the exact SQL to enable RLS with Clerk JWTs")
```

### 🧹 CodeCleanupAgent
**Ask about:** Dead code removal, unused imports, duplicate files

**Example:**
```python
orch.process_request("What are the safest 3,000 lines of dead code I can delete first?")
```

### 🗄️ SchemaIntegrityAgent
**Ask about:** Database schema, missing columns, type sync

**Example:**
```python
orch.process_request("Create migration to add missing authorized_phone columns")
```

### 🧪 TestCoverageAgent
**Ask about:** Test setup, mocking, coverage improvement

**Example:**
```python
orch.process_request("Set up Vitest with Clerk and Supabase mocks")
```

### 🏗️ ArchitectureRefactorAgent
**Ask about:** Code organization, Edge Function usage, separation of concerns

**Example:**
```python
orch.process_request("How do I refactor to use Edge Functions properly?")
```

### 🎵 AudioOptimizationAgent
**Ask about:** Audio upload, file cleanup, streaming

**Example:**
```python
orch.process_request("Fix the race condition in audioUploadService.ts line 117")
```

### 🎨 UIRefactoringAgent
**Ask about:** Component splitting, styling, lazy loading

**Example:**
```python
orch.process_request("Show me how to split the 605-line MainDashboard")
```

### 🚀 DeploymentReadinessAgent
**Ask about:** Production setup, CI/CD, monitoring

**Example:**
```python
orch.process_request("Create a production deployment checklist")
```

## ✅ Pre-flight Checklist

Before starting work:
- [ ] API key set: `echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (should show key)
- [ ] Orchestra works: `python docs/ai/orchestra/start_orchestra.py`
- [ ] Reviewed: `docs/COMPREHENSIVE_REVIEW_2025-09-29.md`
- [ ] Understand: Week 1 priorities (security)
- [ ] Dev server running: `npm run dev` (if needed)

---

## 🎯 Suggested First Session

### 1. Review Current State (5 min)
```python
orch.process_request("""
Based on the comprehensive review:
1. What's the current security score?
2. What are the 3 most critical issues?
3. What should I work on first?
""")
```

### 2. Start with Quick Win (30 min)
```python
orch.process_request("Walk me through deleting dead Supabase Auth code safely")
# Follow instructions, delete files, test build
```

### 3. Tackle Critical Security (2 hours)
```python
orch.process_request("Guide me through enabling RLS step by step")
# Execute SQL, test, verify
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Getting Best Results
✅ **Be specific:** "Fix RLS on profiles table" not "improve security"
✅ **Reference files:** "Fix audioUploadService.ts:117" not "fix uploads"
✅ **Use context:** Orchestra knows comprehensive review, reference it
✅ **Ask for code:** "Show me the exact SQL/code" not just "how to"

### Managing Conversations
- Use `orch.reset_all()` when switching topics
- Check task log: `orch.get_task_log()`
- Save important responses to files
- Re-run if response is generic (shouldn't happen with CoreTet orchestra)

### Validating Changes
- After any fix, run: `npm run build` (should succeed)
- Check git status: `git status`
- Test locally: `npm run dev`
- Use validation prompts: `docs/ai/ai-workflow-v2/validation.md`

## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

### Orchestra Not Working?
```bash
# Check API key
echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Install dependencies
pip install anthropic

# Test client
python docs/ai/orchestra/utils/claude_client.py
```

### Generic Answers?
```python
# Make sure you're using CoreTet orchestra, not generic
from coretet_orchestrator import CoreTetOrchestrator  # ✅ Correct
# NOT: from music_app_orchestrator import ...         # ❌ Wrong

# Reset and rephrase
orch.reset_all()
orch.process_request("[more specific question with file paths]")
```

### Need Different Perspective?
```python
# Ask multiple agents
orch.process_request("""
I need both security and architecture perspectives on:
[your question]
""")
```
