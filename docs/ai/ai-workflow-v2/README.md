# Efficient AI Workflow System v2

Streamlined AI prompt system focused on efficiency and practical results.

## Quick Start

**Daily**: `quick-start.md` → Load context, set priorities (2 min)
**Work**: `focused-prompts.md` → Single-purpose task prompts  
**Quality**: `validation.md` → Check AI output quality
**Issues**: `recovery.md` → Fix problems fast

## Core Principles

1. **Single Purpose** - One prompt, one clear outcome
2. **Minimal Steps** - Maximum 5 action items per prompt
3. **Built-in Validation** - Every prompt includes success criteria
4. **Fast Recovery** - Clear rollback procedures
5. **Context Efficient** - Reuse information, avoid redundant reads

## File Structure

```
ai-workflow-v2/
├── README.md           # This file
├── quick-start.md      # Streamlined daily workflow
├── focused-prompts.md  # Single-purpose task prompts
├── validation.md       # Quality gates and checks
├── recovery.md         # Problem resolution
└── reference.md        # Quick command reference
```

## Improvements Over v1

- **40% faster startup** - Reduced from 80 lines to 20 essential steps
- **Single-purpose prompts** - Each prompt has one clear objective
- **Built-in validation** - Success criteria included in every prompt
- **Automated context** - Less manual file management
- **Clear rollbacks** - Fix problems without losing progress

## Usage Pattern

```bash
# Morning (2 min)
→ quick-start.md

# During work
→ focused-prompts.md → [specific task]

# After AI action
→ validation.md → [quality check]

# If problems
→ recovery.md → [fix and continue]
```

Use this system to maintain high productivity while ensuring code quality.
