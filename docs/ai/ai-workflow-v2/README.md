# Efficient AI Workflow System v2 + Orchestra

Streamlined AI prompt system focused on efficiency and practical results.
**Now integrated with CoreTet Orchestra for specialized guidance.**

## Quick Start

**Daily**: `quick-start.md` + Orchestra priority check (3 min)
**Work**: `focused-prompts.md` + Orchestra task guidance
**Quality**: `validation.md` â†’ Check AI output quality
**Issues**: `recovery.md` or ask Orchestra directly

## ðŸŽµ Orchestra Integration

**Primary Tool:** `../orchestra/coretet_orchestrator.py`

Workflows below now use Orchestra for CoreTet-specific guidance:
```python
from coretet_orchestrator import CoreTetOrchestrator
orch = CoreTetOrchestrator()

# Quick priority check
orch.process_request("What should I prioritize today?")

# Task-specific help
orch.process_request("[use focused-prompts.md patterns here]")
```

## Core Principles

1. **Single Purpose** - One prompt, one clear outcome
2. **Minimal Steps** - Maximum 5 action items per prompt
3. **Built-in Validation** - Every prompt includes success criteria
4. **Fast Recovery** - Clear rollback procedures
5. **Context Efficient** - Reuse information, avoid redundant reads
6. **Orchestra-Enhanced** - Get CoreTet-specific answers, not generic

## File Structure

```
ai-workflow-v2/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md           # This file (Orchestra-integrated)
â”œâ”€â”€ quick-start.md      # Streamlined daily workflow
â”œâ”€â”€ focused-prompts.md  # Single-purpose task prompts
â”œâ”€â”€ validation.md       # Quality gates and checks
â”œâ”€â”€ recovery.md         # Problem resolution
â””â”€â”€ reference.md        # Quick command reference
```

## Improvements Over v1

- **40% faster startup** - Reduced from 80 lines to 20 essential steps
- **Single-purpose prompts** - Each prompt has one clear objective
- **Built-in validation** - Success criteria included in every prompt
- **Automated context** - Less manual file management
- **Clear rollbacks** - Fix problems without losing progress
- **Orchestra integration** - Knows YOUR codebase, not generic apps

## Usage Pattern

```bash
# Morning (3 min)
â†’ quick-start.md
â†’ python ../orchestra/coretet_orchestrator.py
  >>> orch.process_request("What's my priority today?")

# During work
â†’ focused-prompts.md â†’ structure question
â†’ Ask Orchestra for CoreTet-specific guidance

# After AI action
â†’ validation.md â†’ quality check

# If problems
â†’ recovery.md or ask Orchestra
  >>> orch.process_request("How do I fix [issue]?")
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Best Practice

1. **Workflow v2** provides structure and speed
2. **Orchestra** provides CoreTet-specific solutions
3. Use workflow for **efficiency**, Orchestra for **accuracy**
