# üöÄ Agentic Orchestra - Complete Summary

## What Just Happened?

I've upgraded your Orchestra from **advisory-only** to **fully agentic** - meaning the AI agents can now **actually execute development tasks**, not just give advice.

## What You Have Now

### 1. Two Orchestras

#### üìä Advisory Orchestra (Original)
- **Location:** `docs/ai/orchestra/run.sh`
- **Purpose:** Strategic advice, analysis, learning
- **Use for:** Planning, architecture review, questions

#### üöÄ Agentic Orchestra (NEW!)
- **Location:** `docs/ai/orchestra/run-agentic.sh`
- **Purpose:** Execute actual development tasks
- **Use for:** Coding, refactoring, bulk changes

### 2. Three Execution Modes

1. **Preview** - See what would happen (safest)
2. **Execute** - Make changes with safety previews (recommended)
3. **Auto** - Fast execution without previews (use carefully)

### 3. Eight Specialized Agents

Each agent knows your **actual codebase** and its issues:

1. **security** - Fix RLS, rotate keys, JWT validation
2. **cleanup** - Remove 3,000+ lines dead code
3. **schema** - Fix database issues
4. **architecture** - Refactor structure
5. **audio** - Optimize uploads
6. **ui** - Split components
7. **testing** - Add test coverage
8. **deployment** - Production prep

## How to Use It

### From VSCode Terminal

```bash
cd /Users/exleymini/Apps/coretet-band
./docs/ai/orchestra/run-agentic.sh
```

### Example Session

```
üéµ Command: preview Enable RLS on profiles table
# Agent shows you the plan

üéµ Command: execute Enable RLS on profiles table
# Agent reads schema, creates policies, shows previews, executes

üéµ Command: quit
```

Then check what changed:
```bash
git diff
```

## Safety Features Built In

‚úÖ **Preview mode** - See before executing
‚úÖ **Change tracking** - Every action logged
‚úÖ **Git rollback** - Easy undo with `git reset --hard HEAD`
‚úÖ **Execution modes** - Choose your comfort level
‚úÖ **File-by-file** - Changes applied incrementally

## What Can Agents Do?

### Tool Capabilities

- **read_file()** - Read any file in project
- **write_file()** - Create or overwrite files
- **edit_file()** - Replace text in files
- **glob()** - Find files matching patterns
- **grep()** - Search across codebase
- **bash()** - Run shell commands

### Example Tasks

**Security:**
```
execute Enable RLS on all tables with Clerk JWT validation
execute Rotate the exposed API keys
execute Fix weak UUID generation
```

**Cleanup:**
```
execute Remove all dead Supabase Auth code
execute Delete unused imports across the project
execute Remove old authentication screens
```

**Refactoring:**
```
execute Split MainDashboard into smaller components
execute Extract repeated logic into utilities
execute Add proper error handling to all screens
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **AgentToolkit** (`utils/agent_tools.py`)
   - Provides Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash capabilities
   - Tracks all changes for review
   - Preview mode for safety

2. **AgenticExecutor** (`utils/agentic_executor.py`)
   - Wraps agents with tool execution
   - Iterative task execution loop
   - Safety rails and rollback

3. **CoreTetAgenticOrchestra** (`agentic_orchestrator.py`)
   - 8 specialized agents with execution capability
   - Auto-selects best agent for task
   - Manages execution workflow

### How Agents Execute Tasks

1. **Parse request** - Understand what you want
2. **Plan approach** - Break into steps
3. **Use tools** - Read files, analyze code
4. **Generate actions** - Plan specific changes
5. **Preview/Execute** - Show or apply changes
6. **Verify** - Check results, iterate if needed
7. **Report** - Summary of changes made

## Integration with Claude Code (Me)

You now have **two AI assistants** - use them together!

### When to Use Agentic Orchestra

- ‚úÖ Large refactoring ("Remove all dead code")
- ‚úÖ Bulk changes ("Add tests for all services")
- ‚úÖ Well-defined tasks ("Enable RLS on all tables")
- ‚úÖ Repetitive work ("Fix all type errors")

### When to Use Claude Code

- ‚úÖ Exploratory ("How does this work?")
- ‚úÖ Debugging ("Why is this failing?")
- ‚úÖ Design decisions ("Should we use X or Y?")
- ‚úÖ Quick edits ("Change this function")
- ‚úÖ Code review ("Does this look right?")

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Ask me (Claude) for strategy:**
   > "What are the top security priorities?"

2. **Let Agentic Orchestra execute:**
   ```
   execute Enable RLS on profiles table
   ```

3. **Review changes together:**
   ```bash
   git diff
   ```
   > "Claude, does this RLS policy look correct?"

4. **Refine with me:**
   > "Can you adjust the policy to also check band_id?"

5. **Test and commit:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev  # Test
   git commit -m "Add RLS policies"
   ```

git reset --hard HEAD
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (from Comprehensive Review)

1. **Security (Week 1)**
   ```
   execute Enable RLS on all tables with Clerk JWT validation
   execute Rotate exposed API keys
   execute Fix weak UUID generation
   ```

2. **Code Cleanup (Week 2)**
   ```
   execute Remove all dead Supabase Auth code
   execute Delete unused authentication screens
   execute Remove commented code blocks
   ```

3. **Testing (Week 3)**
   ```
   preview Set up Vitest testing framework
   execute Add tests for authentication flow
   execute Add tests for band creation
   ```

## Tips for Success

### ‚úÖ Do's
- Always commit before major tasks
- Preview complex tasks first
- Review diffs after execution
- Test the app after changes
- Be specific in task descriptions

### ‚ùå Don'ts
- Don't use auto mode for complex tasks
- Don't skip previews for destructive changes
- Don't trust blindly - always review
- Don't chain too many tasks at once
- Don't forget to test

## Troubleshooting

### Can't launch orchestra
```bash
cd /Users/exleymini/Apps/coretet-band
./docs/ai/orchestra/run-agentic.sh
```

### Agent made wrong changes
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD
```

### Task keeps looping
Be more specific:
- ‚ùå "Fix everything"
- ‚úÖ "Remove unused imports from AuthContext.tsx"

## Questions?

Come back to Claude Code (me) and ask! I can:
- Explain what the agent did
- Review changes for correctness
- Debug issues
- Refine agent outputs
- Help with complex decisions

## Summary

**What you had before:**
- Advisory Orchestra that gives advice
- Manual coding required

**What you have now:**
- ‚úÖ Agentic Orchestra that executes tasks
- ‚úÖ 8 specialized agents with codebase knowledge
- ‚úÖ Read/Write/Edit/Search/Run capabilities
- ‚úÖ Preview and safety modes
- ‚úÖ Change tracking and rollback
- ‚úÖ Integration with Claude Code

**Impact:**
Instead of manually implementing every recommendation, you can now delegate large tasks to specialized agents while maintaining full control and safety through preview modes and git rollback.
