# Daily Wrap-up Prompts

## End of Day Status Generation

**CRITICAL: Date Verification**
Before creating any EOD file:
1. Run: `date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z"` 
2. Confirm this matches your actual local date/time
3. If there's any discrepancy, use the system date, not your assumed date
4. The filename should be: `./docs/eod-status/[SYSTEM-DATE]-eod.md`

**Step 1: Analyze Today's Work**
1. Review git diff for all changes made today
2. List commits made (git log --oneline --since="midnight")
3. Check current branch status
4. Identify any uncommitted work

**Step 2: Task Accounting**
Review today's planned tasks (from morning session) and categorize:
- ‚úÖ Completed tasks (with commit references)
- üîÑ In Progress (with current state)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Blocked (with reason)
- üìù New tasks discovered today
- üêõ Bugs found but not fixed

**Step 3: Code Quality Summary**
- New TODO/FIXME markers added
- AI-REVIEW sections pending
- Complexity warnings introduced
- Test coverage impact

**Step 4: Generate EOD Markdown**
Create file with TODAY'S ACTUAL DATE (from step 1): `./docs/eod-status/[YYYY-MM-DD]-eod.md`

Use the template below for the file content.

**Step 5: Verification**
After creating the file:
1. List the docs/eod-status/ directory to confirm the file was created
2. Verify the date in the filename matches today's actual date
3. Confirm no duplicate or future-dated files were created

Save this file and confirm creation with: `ls -la ./docs/eod-status/ | tail -5`

## Weekly Status Consolidation

Every Friday, after creating daily EOD:

**Step 0: Date Verification**
Run: `date +"%Y-%m-%d %V"` to confirm today's date and week number.

**Step 1: Aggregate Week's EOD Files**
List all EOD files from this week, sorted by date:
- Run: `ls -la ./docs/eod-status/*-eod.md | grep -v TEMPLATE | sort`
- Read the files from this week (ignore any with suspicious future dates)

**Step 2: Create Weekly Summary**
Generate `./docs/eod-status/weekly/[YYYY-WW]-weekly-summary.md`:
(Use actual year and week number from Step 0)

1. **Week Overview**
   - Total tasks completed
   - Tasks carried over to next week
   - Major achievements
   - Persistent blockers

2. **Metrics Trends**
   - Daily productivity chart
   - Code health trajectory
   - Test coverage changes

3. **AI Workflow Insights**
   - Most effective prompts
   - Tool coordination patterns
   - Suggested process improvements

4. **Next Week Setup**
   - Priority task queue
   - Technical debt to address
   - Learning items identified

Please generate both the daily EOD and weekly summary.
