# Intervention Prompts

## Mid-Day Progress Review

Quick progress check against this morning's plan:

1. Review the morning priorities from today's startup
2. Check current task status
3. Identify any new blockers
4. Adjust afternoon priorities if needed
5. Note any items for today's EOD file

Are we on track for today's goals? What needs to be adjusted?

## STOP - Complexity Reset

The current approach is becoming over-engineered. Let's reset:

1. What's the core problem we're solving?
2. What's the absolute minimal change needed?
3. Can we fix instead of replace?
4. Are we adding unnecessary abstractions?

Provide a simpler solution that:
- Uses existing code where possible
- Adds maximum 20 lines of new code
- Requires no new dependencies
- Can be implemented in under 30 minutes    

Note this reset in today's EOD for process improvement.
