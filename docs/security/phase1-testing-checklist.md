#### 2. View Personal Tracks

- [ ] Can you view personal playlists?

#### 3. Upload New Track
- [ ] Try uploading a new audio file
- [ ] Does it appear in your tracks list?
- [ ] Can you add it to a playlist?

#### 4. Edit Track

- [ ] Does the change save?
- [ ] Does it appear updated?

#### 5. Delete Track
